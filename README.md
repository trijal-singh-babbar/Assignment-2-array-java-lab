# UserInput Class

## Description
The `UserInput` class provides a method for accepting an array of integers from the user via the console.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter 5 numbers.
- Stores the entered numbers in an integer array.
- Returns the array for further processing.

## Usage
1. Create an instance of the `UserInput` class.
2. Call the `arrayInput()` method to receive user input.
3. Use the returned integer array as needed.


# ArrayFunctions Class

## Description
The `ArrayFunctions` class provides utility methods for performing operations on arrays, such as displaying elements, separating odd and even numbers, and finding the minimum difference between consecutive elements.

## Features
- **Display Method:** Prints the contents of an `ArrayList<Integer>`.
- **Odd-Even Separation:** Separates odd and even numbers from an integer array and displays them.
- **Minimum Difference Finder:** Finds and returns the index of the pair of consecutive elements with the smallest difference.

## Usage
1. Create an instance of the `ArrayFunctions` class.
2. Use its methods to perform operations on arrays.


# Main Class

## Description
The `Main` class serves as the entry point of the program. It integrates the `UserInput` and `ArrayFunctions` classes to demonstrate various array operations.

## Features
- Accepts user input for an array of integers.
- Separates odd and even numbers and displays them.
- Finds the index of the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the array.

## Usage
1. Run the `Main` class to execute the program.
2. Enter 5 numbers when prompted.
3. View the separated odd/even numbers and the index of the smallest difference.
